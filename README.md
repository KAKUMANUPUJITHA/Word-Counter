# Word-Counter
This Python code defines a function `word_count` that calculates the number of words in a given text (either a sentence or a paragraph). 
The function takes a string `text` as input and splits it into words using whitespace.
Then it returns the length of the list of words, which effectively represents the count of words in the input text.

The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program. It greets the user with a welcome message and prompts them to input a sentence or a paragraph. It checks if the input is empty and handles the case accordingly by displaying an error message. If the input is not empty, it calls the `word_count` function to calculate the word count and prints the result.

Overall, this code provides a simple command-line interface for users to input text and get the word count as output.
